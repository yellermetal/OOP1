/**
 * A GeoSegment models a straight line segment on the earth. GeoSegments 
 * are immutable.
 * <p>
 * A compass heading is a nonnegative real number less than 360. In compass
 * headings, north = 0, east = 90, south = 180, and west = 270.
 * <p>
 * When used in a map, a GeoSegment might represent part of a street,
 * boundary, or other feature.
 * As an example usage, this map
 * <pre>
 *  Trumpeldor   a
 *  Avenue       |
 *               i--j--k  Hanita
 *               |
 *               z
 * </pre>
 * could be represented by the following GeoSegments:
 * ("Trumpeldor Avenue", a, i), ("Trumpeldor Avenue", z, i),
 * ("Hanita", i, j), and ("Hanita", j, k).
 * </p>
 * 
 * </p>
 * A name is given to all GeoSegment objects so that it is possible to
 * differentiate between two GeoSegment objects with identical
 * GeoPoint endpoints. Equality between GeoSegment objects requires
 * that the names be equal String objects and the end points be equal
 * GeoPoint objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>The following fields are used in the specification:</b>
 * <pre>
 *   name : String       // name of the geographic feature identified
 *   p1 : GeoPoint       // first endpoint of the segment
 *   p2 : GeoPoint       // second endpoint of the segment
 *   length : real       // straight-line distance between p1 and p2, in kilometers
 *   heading : angle     // compass heading from p1 to p2, in degrees
